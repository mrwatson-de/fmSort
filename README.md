# fmSort
Dynamic Sorting for FileMaker.

FileMaker sorting is a powerful feature at the heart of FileMaker databases, the basis for grouping the found set, reporting and charts. 

## The Problem

Filemaker Sorting is powerful :), but static :(.

- Sorts need to be known and statically programmed.
- For n short fields that requires n^2 sorts. 

## The Solution

fmSort changes that. 

- Discover the sort order dynamically.
  - Add sort indicators
- Set the sort order dynamically.


This is

- a **proof-of-concept** demo file **primarily to convince Claris to implement this functionality natively**,
- plus a FileMaker module, which may turn out to be quite useful, even with its limitations :D.

Still in development, but coming to a repository near you in the very near future.
