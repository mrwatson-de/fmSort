# fmSort
Dynamic Sorting for FileMaker.

FileMaker sorting is a powerful feature at the heart of FileMaker databases, the basis for grouping the found set, reporting and charts. 

It is poweful, but static.

- Sorts need to be known and statically programmed.
- For n short fields that requires n^2 sorts. 

fmSort changes that. 

- Discover the sort order dynamically.
  - Add sort indicators
- Set the sort order dynamically.


A proof of concept demo file to convince Claris to implement this functionality natively, plus a FileMaker module, which has turned out to possibly be quite useful :D.

Still in development, but coming to a repository near you in the very near future.
