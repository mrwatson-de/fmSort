# fmSort
Dynamic Sorting for FileMaker.

Discover the sort order dynamically. Set the sort order dynamically.

A proof of concept demo file to convince Claris to implement this functionality natively, plus a FileMaker module, which has turned out to possibly be quite useful :D.

Still in development, but coming to a repository near you in the very near future.
