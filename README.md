# fmSort
Dynamic Sorting for FileMaker.

FileMaker sorting is a powerful feature at the heart of FileMaker databases, the basis for grouping the found set, reporting and charts. 

## The Problem

Filemaker Sorting is powerful :), but static :(.

- It is not possible for a user to build up a sort order bit by bit
- Sorts need to be known and statically programmed in advance.
- It could be possible to write a data driven sort script, 
    but for n sort fields it would require n^2 statically programmed sort record steps.
- The sort dialog can do everything - but is rather overwhelming for most users

In short, sorting is not really low code in FileMaker

## The Solution

fmSort changes that. 

- Discover the sort order dynamically.
  - Add sort indicators
- Set the sort order dynamically.

This is

- a **proof-of-concept** demo file **primarily to convince Claris to implement this functionality natively**,
- plus a FileMaker module, which may turn out to be quite useful, even with its limitations :D.

Still in development, but coming to a repository near you in the very near future.
